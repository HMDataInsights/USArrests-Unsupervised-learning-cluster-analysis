### Introduction
The USArrests - Unsupervised Learning Cluster Analysis project aims to analyze the statistics of arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. The project will involve pre-processing of the data, conducting a PCA analysis, and applying two clustering techniques to generate clusters and analyze them. The project results will provide insights into the relationships between the variables and the common characteristics within each cluster.

### Data Pre-processing
The dataset UsArrests.csv will be used for this project. Before conducting any analysis, the data will be pre-processed to ensure that it is suitable for further analysis. This may involve cleaning and transforming the data as necessary.

### PCA Analysis
A principal component analysis (PCA) will be conducted on the pre-processed data to understand the relationships between the variables. The outcomes of this analysis will be interpreted to understand the most significant variables contributing to the variation in the data.

### Clustering Techniques
Two clustering techniques will be applied to the pre-processed data to generate clusters. The techniques used will be decided based on the results of the PCA analysis. The generated clusters will then be analyzed to understand the common characteristics within each cluster.

### Conclusion
The objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the US Arrests Kaggle dataset by conducting a PCA analysis and applying two clustering techniques. The results of this project will provide insights into the relationships between the variables and the common characteristics within each cluster.
